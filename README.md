Spacecore is a financial administration tool targeted at hackerspaces.

# Project status

The application is far from feature complete and still in active development. Currently Spacecore is mostly functional as a point-of-sale and management system for a canteen. It is being used for that exact purpose at the TkkrLab hackerspace in Enschede, the Netherlands. Come visit us if you're in the area :smiley:

Use at your own risk!

## Docker

Easiest way to run is in docker.

Go to the docker directory and type `docker compse up`

This should start an initalized db + core, at <http://localhost:8080>

(you also need the web admin frontend and cli interface to actually to stuff with it)
